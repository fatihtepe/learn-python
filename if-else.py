'''Python If-Else

Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird

If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird

If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird

If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

1<=n<=100'''

n = int(input('Enter a number: '))

if n % 2 == 1:
    print('odd is weird!')
elif n % 2 == 0 and 2<=n<=5:
    print('Not weird')
elif n % 2 == 0 and 6<=n<=20:
    print('weird')
elif n % 2 == 0 and n > 20:
    print('Not weird')
